## Todo App

---
```make test``` -> run tests

```make run``` -> run development server


## Things todo
1) Need to better understand flask app context. Because many simple things
become much harder to implement.
2) Write more fail tests.
3) Refactor tests to be "DRY".
4) Create docker container.
5) Manage env vars in normal way.
6) Write swagger docs.
